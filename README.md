Notes
=======
This is a fork [DataSift's HubFlow branching model](http://datasift.github.com/gitflow/)
Install it the same, except point at `git@github.com:j-walker23/gitflow.git`
Everything is the same except I tried to complete the latest release that was in progress 1.6.0, and add any nice features/fixes i wanted.

HubFlow
=======

Adds the 'git hf' Git extension to provide high-level repository operations
for [My fork of DataSift's HubFlow branching model](http://datasift.github.com/gitflow/), which is based on [Vincent Driessenâ€™s original blog post](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).
